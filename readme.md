we can setup a proxy server to bypass filtering(when accessibility is not turned off completely)

telegram servers are available entire the world ... any of them has an unique IP which to access telegram we must connect to one of these.
filtering means create a blockage for some people to access these IP.

we should create a server and proxy which is behind the blockage .
proxy means instead of directly connection to telegram (impossible) ,we connect to another computer and by this computer connect to telegram.
This issue exists in computer architecture.
The censorship group can find the IP of these proxy servers and block them.
Because of this we should many proxy servers.

proxy server cant access to data between this two computers.
