# Telegram Proxy

## Overview
Telegram Proxy is a project aimed at bypassing filtering restrictions by setting up a proxy server. The purpose of this proxy server is to allow users to access Telegram even when direct access to Telegram servers is restricted or filtered.

## How It Works
Telegram servers are distributed worldwide, and each server has a unique IP address. Filtering, in this context, refers to the blocking of access to these IP addresses. To circumvent this filtering, we create a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between the user's device and the Telegram servers.

Instead of attempting to directly connect to the Telegram servers (which may be impossible due to filtering), users connect to the proxy server. The proxy server, in turn, establishes a connection to the Telegram servers on behalf of the user. This architecture allows users to access Telegram even when the direct connection is blocked.

## Proxy Server Setup
The proxy server is set up behind the filtering blockage, meaning it is accessible even in regions where direct access to Telegram servers is restricted. It is important to note that the proxy server itself cannot access the data being transmitted between the user's device and the Telegram servers. Its role is solely to facilitate the connection between the two endpoints.

## Dockerization
This project has been dockerized for ease of deployment and management. Docker allows for the creation of lightweight, portable containers that encapsulate all the necessary dependencies and configurations for running the proxy server. By dockerizing the project, setup and deployment become simpler and more consistent across different environments.

## Conclusion
Telegram Proxy provides a solution for users who are facing filtering restrictions on accessing Telegram. By setting up a proxy server, users can bypass these restrictions and connect to Telegram servers even in regions where direct access is blocked. The project's dockerization further simplifies deployment and management, making it accessible to a wider audience.
